# Your Text, Your Style — Auto-Generate a Presentation

Turn bulk text, markdown, or prose into a fully formatted PowerPoint **styled from your uploaded template**. No AI image generation — the app reuses images already present in the template/presentation.

## ✨ Features
- Paste long-form text or Markdown
- Optional one-line guidance (e.g., “turn into an investor pitch deck”)
- Bring your own LLM key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) — **never stored or logged**
- Upload a `.pptx` or `.potx` file; the generated deck inherits its theme, colors, fonts, and layouts
- Smart slide count & content mapping (LLM or heuristic fallback)
- Optional speaker notes via LLM
- Download the resulting `.pptx`

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, `python-pptx`
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + Tailwind
- **LLMs:** OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini (user-supplied API key)

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1) Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2) Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
# In another terminal: backend must run on http://localhost:8000
# Optionally set VITE_API_URL to point elsewhere
```

## 🧩 How it Works (200–300 words)
The app first ingests your raw text and an optional one-line guidance (e.g., “investor pitch”). A small router sends your prompt to the LLM of your choice (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini) using **your** API key (provided per-request only and never stored). The model is instructed to return **strict JSON** that describes the deck structure: an optional overall title and a sequence of slides, each with a title, concise bullet points, and—if enabled—speaker notes. When an API key or provider isn’t provided, a heuristic fallback parses Markdown headings or paragraph breaks to produce sensible slide boundaries and bullets.

Next, the backend loads your uploaded PowerPoint template using `python-pptx`. It **starts the new presentation from your template**, so theme colors, fonts, and slide layouts are inherited automatically. For each slide in the structured JSON, the builder adds a “Title and Content” style slide (or the closest available layout), sets the title, then writes bullets into the body placeholder. If the template contains images, the app **reuses** them by cycling through existing pictures and placing one unobtrusively on each slide. If a global deck title is provided, a title slide is added using layout 0 when available. Optional speaker notes are injected into the notes pane for each slide.

Finally, the finished `.pptx` is streamed back to the browser for download. No images are generated by AI and no sensitive data is persisted. The result is a clean, styled deck that mirrors the visual identity of your template.

## 🔐 Privacy
- API keys are sent only with your request and are **never logged or persisted**.
- Files are processed in-memory; temporary files created for download are short-lived.

## 🛠️ Configuration & Limits
- Template max size: 40MB (edit in `backend/main.py` if needed).
- Slide cap (fallback mode): ~20 slides (edit in `llm_router._heuristic_split`).
- You can change default slide layout index in `build_presentation`.

## 🌐 Deploy
- **Backend:** Render, Railway, Fly.io, or Docker on any VPS.
- **Frontend:** Vercel/Netlify. Set `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL at build time.
